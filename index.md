## About me

I'm a PhD student in Bioinformatics at Breast Cancer Translational Research Laboratory at Institut Jules Bordet (Université libre de Bruxelles) in Brussels, where I'm currently working on bulk, single cell and spatial transcriptomics data applied to luminal breast cancer. In particular, I'm applying state of the art methods to analyse tumor heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment of such kind of tumor and I have a strong interest and experience in machine learning and deep learning methods applied to various biological problems.
