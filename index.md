# Hi, I'm Matteo!

_I'm a PhD student in Bioinformatics at "Breast Cancer Translational Research Laboratory J.C. Heuson" at Institut Jules Bordet (Université libre de Bruxelles) in Brussels, where I'm currently working on bulk, single cell and spatial transcriptomics data in luminal breast cancer. My aim is to study heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment applying state of the art and in house built methods. I have experience and a strong interest in machine learning, deep learning methods and molecular anthropology.
Beyond science, I like music, photography, travelling and volunteering in areas such as childcare and education._

## Others
I've been backpacking in more then twenty countries around the world, having the opportunity to meet and to get in deep contact with different cultures around Africa, Asia, Europe and America. I had the opportunity do volunteer many times in different kind of countries, such as in India ("Nava Jeevana Rehabilitation Center", Bellary), Tanzania ("Mbweni public school", Mbweni - Dar es Salaam), Brazil ("Casa do Menor Brasil", Miguel Couto - Rio de Janeiro) in the areas of education and childcare. I've been the social media manager for a couple of years for the NGO "Casa do Menor Italia" (Cuneo, IT), managing the communication of the association through the principal social networks.
